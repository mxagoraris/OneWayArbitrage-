# One Way Arbitrage
This implementation is reading an excel file containing a 7x7 quotation matrix and given the start and the end currencies it identifies arbitrage opportunities.
It controls the validity of the currencies in case that the user enters a non valid currency it asks again to insert a valid currency.
Finally, it prints all the possibilities of the one way arbitrage.
